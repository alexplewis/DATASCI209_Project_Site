For starters, at least four of the top five organizations by number of launches are developing some form of reusable rocket technology, which could be a key factor in decreased costs per launch.

Instead of larger-scale missions, like putting astronauts on the moon, many of these companies are traveling shorter distances, and in less time. ULA, for example, is primarily focused on getting satellites into Earth&#x27;s orbit.
