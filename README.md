# DATASCI209_Project_Site

This website was created by Alex Lewis, David Carlson, and Xienyam Chiu as part of our final project for DATASCI 209: Data Visualization with the University of California, Berkeley.

We hope this site serves as a resource for a wide range of audiences — from educators and students to space enthusiasts and curious learners — offering insights into how launch activity, spending, and innovation have evolved over time.

All data related to launches and spending was sourced from NextSpaceFlight.
