# DATASCI209_Project_Site

This website was created by Alex Lewis, David Carlson, and Xienyam Chiu as part of a final project for DATASCI 209: Data Visualization during the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program.

The site is currently hosted at:
https://space-exploration-209.netlify.app/

We hope this site serves as a resource for a wide range of audiences — from educators and students to space enthusiasts and curious learners — offering insights into how launch activity, spending, and innovation have evolved over time.

All data related to launches and spending was sourced from NextSpaceFlight.
